name: Rotate
notes: |
  Utilities for applying slight rotations to elements. This can help give a
  whimsical appearance to otherwise rectilinear or symmetrical elements.

  So far, only a couple have been included to give book covers some character
  in promotional content. But the naming convention mimics that of [our
  size utilities](#size) to make it easy to expand on in the future.

  - `u-rotate1of60` rotates an element 6 degrees clockwise.
  - `u-rotateCounter1of60` rotates an element 6 degrees counter-clockwise.

  Breakpoint variations are included as well:

  - `u-sm-rotateXofY`
  - `u-sm-rotateCounterXofY`
  - `u-md-rotateXofY`
  - `u-md-rotateCounterXofY`
  - `u-lg-rotateXofY`
  - `u-lg-rotateCounterXofY`
