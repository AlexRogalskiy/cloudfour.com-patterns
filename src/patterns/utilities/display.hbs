notes: |
  Includes the standard SUIT CSS display utilities:

  + `u-block` sets display to `block`.
  + `u-hidden` sets display to `none`.
  + `u-hiddenVisually` visually hides element in an accessible way.
  + `u-inline` sets display to `inline`.
  + `u-inlineBlock` sets display to `inline-block`.
  + `u-table` sets display to `table`.
  + `u-tableCell` sets display to `table-cell`.
  + `u-tableRow` sets display to `table-row`.

  Also includes responsive versions of `u-hidden` and `u-block`. Examples:

  + `u-sm-block` sets display to `block` starting at `--sm-viewport`.
  + `u-md-block` sets display to `block` starting at `--md-viewport`.
  + `u-lg-hidden` sets display to `none` starting at `--lg-viewport`.

  Also includes two original utilities:

  + `u-hiddenTillFocus` works like `u-hiddenVisually`, except the element is
    displayed if it receives keyboard focus.
  + `u-testBlock` makes an element's dimensions inspectable by JavaScript
    without displaying it visually.
