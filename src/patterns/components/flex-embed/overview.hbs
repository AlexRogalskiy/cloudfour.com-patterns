  For use with media embeds (videos, slideshows, etc.) that need to retain a
  specific aspect ratio while adapting to the width of their containing element.

  The `.FlexEmbed-ratio` element is a hack, but a useful one; it insures that
  `max-height` values are respected. It also allows one-off using a `style`
  attribute and `padding-top`.
