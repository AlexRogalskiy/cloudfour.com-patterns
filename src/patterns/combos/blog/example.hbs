  When I look at a problem, it will always be from the perspective of a
  designer. I like to solve the big problem, piecing the code together to get my
  idea out as quickly as possible. Then I worry about making the code better
  later. The main point is getting the design, or the experience out of my head
  and into the browser, where I can squish my screen, or pull it up on my phone.
  I don’t have to be an amazing developer, or a decent developer or even
  developer at all. I just need the tools necessary to realize my vision for the
  design problem I am trying to solve.

  I like to look at having technical skills the same way I would look at having
  presentation skills. Or project management, writing, and concepting skills. We
  are not just pixel pushers, we are designers. We are complex thinkers, makers
  and problem solvers. That goes way beyond just the presentation layer of a
  design. It’s about a breadth of knowledge that informs your creative process.
  Code informing visual design. And vice versa, visual design informing the
  code.
