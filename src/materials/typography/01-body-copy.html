  <strong>Though Lausanne is so near Geneva,</strong> its history, in historical
  times, has been widely different from that of the neighbouring town. Geneva
  enjoyed a modified independence from an early date, and became completely
  independent early in the sixteenth century. Lausanne, until nearly 300 years
  later, endured the domination, first of Savoy, and subsequently of Berne.

  <em>The early history is obscure and full of vexed questions</em> as well as
  unfamiliar names; but the central fact is that the Counts of Savoy—they were
  not promoted to be Dukes of Savoy until later—took possession of the Canton of
  Vaud, as well as of the Chablais and the lower Valais, after the death of the
  last of the Zaeringen, at the beginning of the thirteenth century.
