      We pride ourselves on being adaptive to the project’s needs – we don’t have a one size fits all process. This is part of our DNA (and part of our differentiation as a company.) Here’s how we are adapting to fit our own project’s needs.

    excerpt: |
      Our team had a set of defining characteristics and was almost ready to start redesigning cloudfour.com. But before we dived into element collages, we wanted to draw from a shared well of design inspiration. So we decided to make a mood board.

    excerpt: |
      When we started redesigning cloudfour.com, I knew I wanted the entire team to feel a sense of ownership in the end result. Fortunately for us, few problems in the universe cannot be solved by getting in a room and writing things on sticky notes.
