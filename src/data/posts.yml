      We recently got the opportunity to develop a service worker for use on Smashing Magazine, which we'll write about in more detail soon. This is the first of a multi-part article that will examine some of the solutions we arrived at and lessons we learned.

    excerpt: |

    excerpt: |
      When we started redesigning cloudfour.com, I knew I wanted the entire team to feel a sense of ownership in the end result. Fortunately for us, few problems in the universe cannot be solved by getting in a room and writing things on sticky notes.
