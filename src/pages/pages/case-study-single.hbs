  <p class="TextBlock">In 2014, we were asked to help Walmart transition to responsive design. We started with the smaller <a href="http://grocery.walmart.com">Walmart Grocery site</a>, built a pattern library, and converted the site to responsive design in three months. We finished a week ahead of schedule due to our <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-power-of-responsive-design-sprints/">responsive design sprint</a> approach.</p>

  <p>After that project, Walmart asked us to help with the main <a href="walmart.com">Walmart.com</a> site starting with the complex cart and checkout process.</p>

  <p>Walmart had recently redesigned so any responsive plans that required a full redesign were non-starters. But Walmart wasn't looking for a quick, responsive retrofit either. They wanted to do a responsive redesign the right way, which is why they hired us to assist their team.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, we have a lot of experience with what we call <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/converting-an-existing-site-or-app-to-a-responsive-design/">responsive conversions</a>â€”taking a working fixed-width design and making it responsive. The key is to break the site into small design patterns and make those patterns responsive.</p>

  <p>After we broke the designs down into constituent patterns, we built an agile sprint schedule. <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-power-of-responsive-design-sprints/">Responsive design sprints</a> are powerful tools for finding the best design quickly through rapid iteration.</p>

  <p>One of the best parts of working with Walmart was the ability to work closely with their UX team. We worked as a cohesive team with constant communication in Slack throughout the day. One of the Walmart designers embedded in our team.</p>

  <p>Like many of our projects, our responsibilities included more than the design. During our time working with Walmart Labs, we built a single-page application based on CanJS and implemented designs in Walmart's Node.js backend system.</p>

  <p>It was one of the best projects we've ever worked on. We're proud of how Walmart's new responsive sites turned out.</p>
